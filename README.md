# Stock Market Analysis ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¹

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices using historical data and Machine Learning techniques. The analysis includes cleaning, exploring, visualizing, and modeling stock market data to gain insights and make predictions.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Historical stock market data (CSV format)
- **Columns:** Ticker, Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume
- **Description:** Contains historical stock prices and trading volumes for multiple companies.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:** 
   - Loaded CSV data.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., other tickers not needed for target analysis).
   - Selected the target stock for prediction.
2. **Data Cleaning:** 
   - Handled missing values.
   - Converted dates into proper datetime format.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Plotted stock trends over time.
   - Visualized correlation between features.
   - Observed volume and price fluctuations.
4. **Feature Scaling:** 
   - Applied StandardScaler for preparing features for ML models.
5. **Modeling & Prediction:** 
   - Built predictive models for stock prices.
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score**.
6. **Visualization:** 
   - Plotted actual vs predicted prices.
   - Displayed trends and key insights using graphs.

---

## Key Results
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1.0578  
- **RÂ² Score:** 0.9859  
- Visualizations helped identify trends and fluctuations in stock prices.  
- Stock price prediction accuracy was validated using historical data.
